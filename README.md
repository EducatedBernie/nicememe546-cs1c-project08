// TODO: For every project create a README file at the top-level directory of 
//       your project. Your README must include a list of .java files you are 
//       submitting and a brief description of each. You may ignore IDE specific 
//       files such as .gitignore 

// NOTE: Alternatively you can create this file in Markdown format. 
//       See the tutorial:
//       https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/


- src/FHsort.java
* This is a compilation of the various algorithm taught by the modules.

- src/Test.java
 * This class tests different time for our quicksort algorithm. It investigates the effect
 * of recursion limits in increments of 2s (2..4..6..) until 300. This is repeated across
 * different arrays sizes, from 20,000 to almost 10 million.
